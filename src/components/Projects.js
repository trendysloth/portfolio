									<h3>Gender Classification and Bias Mitigation in Facial Images</h3>
									<time>
									Gender classification algorithms have important applications in many domains today such as demographic research, law enforcement, as well as human-computer interaction. Recent research showed that algorithms trained on biased benchmark databases could result in algorithmic bias. However, to date, little research has been carried out on gender classification algorithms' bias towards gender minorities subgroups, such as the LGBTQ and the non-binary population, who have distinct characteristics in gender expression.

									<h3>NeRF applied to satellite imagery for surface reconstruction</h3>
									<time>
										We present Sat-NeRF, a modified implementation of the recently introduced Shadow Neural Radiance Field (S-NeRF) model. This method is able to synthesize novel views 
										from a sparse set of satellite images of a scene, while accounting for the variation in lighting present in the pictures.

									<h3>Why did I become a software engineer</h3>
								<time>
								
									I got asked this question so many times at job interviews or sometimes even when I meet a new person. You are an architecture major and why are you a software engineer now? 

									My interest in computation started at an early age when I was in elementary school playing with the LOGO sea turtle drawing software in my computer classes. I always find computers interesting but somehow I 
									never thought about majoring in computer science in college.

									In architecture school, my interest in computer science gradually grew, I was drawn to various design and parametric softwares. Finally, one year I took a CS course that taught me the k-means clustering algorithm. 
									Somehow I was immediately hooked about how simple and beautiful k-means is. Yes, I want to learn more about computers ... 
								</time>
								<time>
									And the rest is the history. I could write another five pages here about my CS journey in grad school. But one thing that I resonated with the most is the Antidisciplinary approach brought up by the MIT media lab.
									An antidisciplinary project isn't a sum of a bunch of disciplines but something entirely new - the word defies easy definition. It is someone or something that doesn't fit within traditional academic discipline-a field of study with its own particular words, frameworks, and methods.
								</time>
								<time>
									So why are we so dogmatic about what we studied in college? The world is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary these days, why can't we each adopt our own anti-discinplinary approach to our own life?

									Computers are fasincating... Be it LOGO sea turtle, Be it Red Dead Redemption, Be it Neural Networks, Be it Rhinoceros. 
									Architecture is also fasincating... Be it I.M.Pei, Gothic churches, Bernini, Borromini. 
									
									Without architecture, where do we go play with our computers?
									Without computers, how do we make cool architecture?

									We can't live without computers now. Neither have we ever been able to live without architecture.
									I love both subjects and they are important parts of my life.
